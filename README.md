# EXECUTIVE-COMMAND-CENTER


💎 1. Project Overview: Executive Command Center

The Executive Command Center is a Streamlit-based web app designed to give professionals, traders, and networkers a single luxury-style interface to manage four high-impact activities:

    pytz: Timezone handling.

    datetime: Time calculations.

    threading: Background message scheduling without freezing the UI.

⚙️ 4. Project Structure

🔐 7. Security & Limitations
✅ Safe

    No server-side data storage.

    No login or user authentication required.

⚠️ Limitations

    Uses webbrowser.open to simulate sending — doesn’t interact with WhatsApp APIs directly.

    Doesn’t verify if the recipient number is valid.

    Limited to devices with browser access.

💡 8. Future Improvements

    Add a login system with Streamlit Authenticator.

    Store messages in a local SQLite database.

    Use Telegram Bots or WhatsApp APIs for direct message integration.

    Enhance charting with live financial APIs (like yfinance, alpaca, or polygon.io).

    Enable real-time chat with socket.io or Streamlit WebSocket.
